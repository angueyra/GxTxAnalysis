Substates:

	- Define 'substate'
		- Quantify freq of substates -> ignored
		- Toss open times < 1?? ms -> define from traces with obvious substates and pick threshold that eliminates substates optimally (make supp figure)
	- "junk" and substates
		- make that piece of data NaN and consider state didn't change in between (stiching)
		- same criterion for all cells
		- again quantify frequency
		- other junk that doesn't fit criteria -> delete traces if fairly rare
